### Why?

I didn't want to go straight into a generic 'create-react-app' or next.js framefork. But I also seem to come up with ideas every few days, but the ambition is greater than the resources available to me! 

So I plan to use this starter as the base for any App I create in the future. 

I most likely will find a better nodeJS starter out in the web but this one has been great as a learning exercise. But...I must admit, harder and bigger than I thought!
